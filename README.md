# Hi, I’m Marish R 👋

I build and ship products with a focus on **clean engineering**, **practical problem-solving**, and **measurable impact**.  
Currently working at **Skalable**.

---

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- Building and improving product features that users actually feel
- Strengthening reliability, performance, and developer workflows
- Learning in public through small projects and experiments

---

## 🧰 Tech I use
**Languages:** `JavaScript/TypeScript` · `Python` · `SQL`  
**Backend:** `Node.js` · `REST` · `Auth` · `Queues`  
**Frontend:** `React` · `Next.js` · `UI systems`  
**Data/Infra:** `Postgres` · `Redis` · `Docker` · `CI/CD`

> Replace the stack above with what’s true for you — or tell me your stack and I’ll tailor it.

## 📌 Featured projects
Here are a few things I’m proud of (pin these on your GitHub profile):

- **Project 1 — <name>**  
  Short one-liner: what it does + impact.  
  _Tech:_ X, Y, Z  
  _Link:_ <repo link>

- **Project 2 — <name>**  
  Short one-liner: what it does + impact.  
  _Tech:_ X, Y, Z  
  _Link:_ <repo link>

- **Project 3 — <name>**  
  Short one-liner: what it does + impact.  
  _Tech:_ X, Y, Z  
  _Link:_ <repo link>

## 🧠 Principles I like working by
- Ship small, iterate fast
- Make it understandable before making it clever
- Measure impact, not effort
- Automate the boring parts

_If you share 3–5 repos you want highlighted + your main tech stack + your role (backend/frontend/full-stack/data), I’ll rewrite this to match your actual history exactly._
